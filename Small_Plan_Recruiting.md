> Small Plan for Recruiting More Teams
> ---
> Hello every one! These two days I spent some time to communicate with my friends about their opinions about the Hult Prize and why they want or don't want to compete (of course they all pretty active students). I got some info that I can share with you.
>  
- Target students:  Some of them already know our projects but may check it carefully, because they are mostly M2 student (those I am familiar) and are busy finding jobs or dealing with their research topics. So, it's important that we **focus on M1/D1 students** which have more free time. For Japanese undergraduate student, I still do not have much ideas how to attract their attention. 
- Our Support is not enough: There are a few of them are pretty interested in our program, but they pretty afraid that they can not find good partners from different backgrounds, so they prefer to join a team but not organize a team. I think we should have a **database of students about their major and possible contributions** to the team, if they want to join but don't want to make a team themselves. Mainly there are three contribution parts that might be divided: **1. Identifying& Analyze problem 2. Technical solution proposal 3. Sustainable commercial operation model** Then we should try to help initial the organization of a new team if they want us to help.
- Our idea should be more concise: some of them checked our poster and even visit our homepages but still don't have clear idea about our project, since recent people prefer short and twitter-like messages. Here is what I use to introduce our projects: **"Hult Prize is a worldwide start-up accelerator for top Universities. It start from the challenge inside campus and the winner can compete in one of five cities for second round: Shanghai/Dubai/London/Boston/San Francisco and the final winning team will have 1 million dollar and other support for their ideas. This year Hult Prize focus on refugee problem, any idea to helping to solve Living condition/ Health/ Humanistic care/Re-employment/... are welcome. The final for University of Tokyo is 10th December. Simply to say, you need 3-4 members for one team, and think about some enterprise ideas about the refugees, then have the final presentation about your plan during Saturday 10th December"** If they are interested, more detailed info can be sent to them. Note: I am talking about when you talking to someone that are really suitable for our projects not everyone.

>About my own plans, Lu and I will try to encourage new M1 students by directly posting messages into a 300-people group chat room. And seek some help from Japanese friends in our lab and see if they can recommend some active Japanese students. I already got some possible candidates: 1 IT background, 1 business background and 2 engineering background. I will try to help to make a new team.
One suggestion for you: **It seems more efficient to start talking to your friends, even they can not attend, you can ask for their recommendation for possible team members**. Another issue, Lu and me can guarantee we can reach all Chinese students and some Japanese and Koreans, but we don't have very efficient way for western people, maybe Alba and Lisa can help with seeking possible candidates. 
This is my basic idea, if you have some details to add or suggestions please tell us. Wish you enjoying your weekend and wish us good luck!
